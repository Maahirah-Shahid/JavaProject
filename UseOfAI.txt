I used AI in the ‘Spritesheet’ class of my code and the animation.
The 'Spritesheet' class was made in order to aid me in
the cutting of the spritesheets I would use in my game into individual
sprites. It is a class similar to the ‘PolygonEditor’ class in that it
will help make it easier for me to manage making the game. All it does
is cut a box out of whatever spritesheet I provide, and then creates a new
file on my laptop for it. At first, I asked the AI to add them to an array,
but when the code got a little too complicated for me to wrap my head around,
I changed the prompt to ask for if the AI could, instead, create a new file
on my laptop for the sprites I would cut up. After having figured that out,
I used it to cut the individual frames, which I then went on to also
ask ai for help with animating. The AI helped me understand how to write an
image file onto my laptop, based on another image uploaded into my code and
then helped me with understanding how to then animate images, which also led
to me figuring out how to animate images so that the animation only loops
through once.
